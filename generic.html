									<p>I am a highly skilled Data Analyst with a strong foundation in data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning modeling. I have hands-on experience in Python, SQL, T-SQL, R, Java, Tableau, and Power BI, allowing me to tackle complex datasets and generate valuable insights. In my Cyclistic bike-share analysis project, I successfully managed over 5 million records, utilized Python for data cleaning and outlier elimination, and performed geospatial and time series analysis to forecast trends. My technical expertise extends to tools like Spark for big data processing and data mining, where I consistently deliver actionable insights and improve decision-making processes.</p>
									<p>In addition to my technical capabilities, I have a solid understanding of cloud technologies and am currently pursuing AWS Cloud Associate certification. I also hold a Google Data Analytics certificate, further enhancing my skills in data-driven solutions. I have led multiple workshops on machine learning models, including regression, decision trees, and clustering techniques, and have collaborated with cross-functional teams to develop robust data products. My passion for analytics, combined with a commitment to continuous learning, makes me confident in my ability to deliver impactful results and contribute meaningfully to any team.</p>

									<h2>Python</h2>
									<p>I used Python extensively for data analysis, data cleaning, and machine learning modeling. At intone networks for data analysis tasks and in projects like Cyclistic bike-share, I leveraged libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for large dataset manipulation, ensuring data integrity and generating insights efficiently.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>SQL & T-SQL</h2>
									<p>I designed optimized SQL data models, improving data-driven decision-making by 12%. My proficiency in SQL and T-SQL was crucial in automating data aggregation processes, leading to more streamlined cross-departmental evaluations at Intone Networks.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Tableau & Power BI</h2>
									<p>I built interactive dashboards to analyze customer data for products in Tableau and Power BI, providing insightful visualizations. My work with Tableau dashboards for Cyclistic and COVID-19 datasets enabled users to identify trends and make informed decisions based on visualized data.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
									<p>I developed machine learning models using algorithms like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machine. These models achieved high accuracy in projects like Job Change Prediction, where I conducted in-depth analysis of large datasets to predict behavior.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Deep Learning</h2>
									<p>I applied CNNs and RNNs for deep learning in an Image Captioning project, achieving 92% accuracy. I integrated Inception V3 for feature extraction, reducing training time and outperforming other models.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Data Mining</h2>
									<p>I utilized data mining techniques to uncover insights from large datasets, particularly in genre analysis for Verzeo EdTech. I performed regression and classification tasks to extract meaningful patterns and drive decision-making.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Spark</h2>
									<p>I used Apache Spark for handling large-scale data efficiently, especially in scenarios requiring distributed data processing, such as the Cyclistic bike-share project, ensuring scalability and performance.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>R Programming</h2>
									<p>I employed R for statistical analysis, using packages like ggplot2, tidyr, and dplyr in the COVID-19 dataset analysis. This enabled me to uncover demographic trends and correlations, adding depth to my analysis.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Java</h2>
									<p>My knowledge of Java has been applied in various software development tasks, particularly in building robust applications and performing back-end development tasks for more structured and object-oriented programming solutions.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>AWS Cloud (in progress)</h2>
									<p>Currently, I am working towards obtaining my AWS Cloud Associate certification to enhance my cloud computing skills, ensuring I can effectively manage and deploy data-driven solutions in cloud environments.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Google Data Analytics Certification</h2>
									<p>My certification in Google Data Analytics has strengthened my data analysis capabilities, allowing me to perform end-to-end data analysis with a strong focus on business insights and decision-making.</p>
